CONTRIBUTING
============

Thanks for the contribution to the wiki!
We do not want to enforce strict policies,
these are merely etiquettes for commiting
to the wiki.


Index
-----

This guideline includes:

- Adding Titles
- Markdown conventions
- Code Snippets
- Adding Links


Adding Titles
-------------

You can add titles by adding the following to the beginning
of a page's line.

    Title: Installing your favourite program

And it will appear on the wiki index as so.

Markdown Conventions
--------------------

It is good practice to have the raw text files as easily readable
as they are formatted. The webpage is also generated from 'discount',
a simplistic markdown converter.

If you are not using the third header (###), do not use hashes. Use
slashes and equal signs, just as it is in this piece of text. It gives
better sense of headers in plain-text.


Code Snippets
-------------

Instead of using "```" (three backticks) for adding code snippets,
add 4 spaces for indentation, which will also result in code snippets.

Ex:

    -> kiss b e2fsprogs

If you are adding inline code, backticks are fine.


Adding links
------------

If you want to add a link to a webpage, do it like this. Assume you
are linking the webpage.

    bla bla bla [Carbs Linux] bla bla.
    
    End of the file
    [Carbs Linux]: https://carbslinux.org

Which will produce a clickable link when formatted, and better readability
when it isn't.
